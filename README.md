## Java-Based Sudoku Solver
# Overview
This project implements a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. The solver efficiently solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles by exploring all possible solutions and backtracking when necessary. Various optimizations are implemented to enhance performance and accuracy.

# Features
Backtracking Algorithm: Uses recursive techniques to find the solution.
Constraint Propagation: Ensures numbers are placed correctly without violating Sudoku rules.
Performance Optimizations: Includes techniques such as constraint propagation and forward checking.

# Methods Breakdown
# Main Method and Board Initialization
The 9x9 Sudoku board is initialized with preset values and zeros for empty cells.

# Solve Method
Recursively attempts to solve the Sudoku puzzle by finding an empty cell and placing numbers from 1 to 9 if it's safe to do so.

# isSafe Method
Checks if a number can be placed in a specific cell without violating Sudoku rules (no repetition in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).

# Display Method
Prints the solved Sudoku board or indicates if the puzzle cannot be solved.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a robust approach to solving Sudoku puzzles using Java and the backtracking algorithm. By incorporating various optimization techniques, the solver achieves significant performance improvements.
